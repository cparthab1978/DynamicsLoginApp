Programming Question Two (Provide solution)
You are asked to create a simple web application. It will need to have a front end (use any website technology (mvc, react, angular,css,html, etc..) that can be displayed on a browser and have a backend connected to some sort of permanent data storage (this can be either a "flat file database" or MySQL Database). The site will consist of two screens:

1) A login screen. The user can enter a username and password to log in. If they do not have an account, there should be the option to create an account. When customers create a login it should have (minimally requiring)
- Username
- Password
- Account number (an account number generated automatically by the system)

2) An account status page. After successfully logging in, the system should show the account status page. It will display their username, account number, and total dynamics credits. There should also be a button to add one Dynamics Credit to the current logged in account. It should then keep track of dynamics credits per account.
- Should be an option to log out if you are logged in.
